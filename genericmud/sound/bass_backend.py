"""Native audio backend: plays SoundBus cues through BASS, the library soundpacks are made for.

The same contract as the pygame backend: one cue at a time on each logical channel (a new cue
there replaces the one playing), one music stream, live volume and pan changes, and a file
that's missing or unreadable reported once. BASS mixes any number of streams at once, so
unlike pygame there's no pool of channels to share out and no cue is ever cut off for another.

It also does what pygame couldn't: a cue's pitch changes live (VIPMud's #PC Frequency), a
cue starts and finishes where a MUD says within its file and fades in, out and away
(Client.Media), each done the way Mudlet does it, and a cue takes BASS's effects (the echo,
reverb, flanger and gargle ChatMUD asks Chatpack for; see bass_effects).

Build it with :func:`make_sound_backend`, which uses BASS when the build has it and an audio
device opens, and pygame otherwise.
